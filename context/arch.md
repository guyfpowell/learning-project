# Learning App — Architectural Context

## Project Overview

**Product**: AI-native micro-learning platform generating personalized 3-minute daily lessons for product managers, product leaders, and AI practitioners.

**Current Status**: Phase 3 (Web Frontend) ✅ COMPLETE. All auth, dashboard, lesson, quiz, progress, and settings pages functional. Ready for Phase 4 (Mobile App).

**Architecture**: Monorepo (pnpm) with TypeScript, Express backend, Next.js 14 frontend, PostgreSQL + Redis.

---

## System Architecture Layers

### 1. Data Layer (PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM)

**Key Models**:
- **User** — Authentication, email, password hash. Has UserProfile, UserProgress, Subscriptions, Notifications, NotificationPreference.
- **UserProfile** — Extended user data: goal, timezone, learningStyle, preferredTime.
- **Skill** — Skill domains (e.g., "product-management", "ai-engineering"). Linked via SkillPath.
- **SkillPath** — Progression levels (beginner/intermediate/advanced) within a skill. Contains Lessons.
- **Lesson** — Individual lessons (day 1, day 2, etc.) with title, content, media URL. Links to Quizzes and UserProgress.
- **Quiz** — Multiple-choice questions tied to lessons with correctAnswer + explanation.
- **UserProgress** — Tracks completion, quiz score (0-100), streak count, last lesson date per user-lesson pair.
- **Subscription** / **SubscriptionPlan** — Billing model (free, starter, pro, premium). Tracks Stripe IDs, status, expiry.
- **NotificationPreference** — Per-user toggle settings for daily reminders, streak notifications, lesson available alerts.
- **Notification** — Audit log of sent notifications with type + click tracking.

**Schema Patterns**:
- Cascading deletes on user deletion (profile, progress, subscriptions, notifications all cascade).
- Unique constraints: (userId, lessonId) in UserProgress; (userId) in Subscription; (skillId, level) in SkillPath.
- Indexes on userId for fast lookups (UserProgress, Subscription, Notification, NotificationPreference).

---

### 2. Backend API (Express + TypeScript)

**Architecture**: Route → Controller → Service → Prisma

**Key Routes**:
- **Auth** (`/api/auth`): `POST /register`, `POST /login`, `GET /me` (protected)
- **Users** (`/api/users`): GET/PATCH profile, user info (protected)
- **Lessons** (`/api/lessons`): GET today's lesson, GET lesson by ID, POST complete lesson, POST quiz submission (all protected)
- **Subscriptions** (`/api/subscriptions`): GET plans, POST create subscription, webhook handlers (protected)
- **Notifications** (`/api/notifications`): GET/PATCH user notification preferences (protected)

**Auth Pattern**:
- JWT access tokens (15m expiry) stored in Authorization header (Bearer token).
- Refresh tokens (30d) stored as SHA-256 hashes in Redis (`refresh:{userId}`).
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` rotates both tokens. `POST /api/auth/logout` revokes refresh token.
- authMiddleware extracts JWT, validates, sets `req.user` (id + email + role), and sets Sentry user context.
- Web + mobile both have 401 interceptors that auto-refresh silently before redirecting to login.

**Error Handling**:
- AppError class: `new AppError(code, message, statusCode)`.
- Controllers delegate errors to `next(error)` → caught by error-handler middleware.
- Middleware returns structured JSON error responses.

**Service Layer** (Business Logic):
- **AuthService**: register, login, getUserById. Bcryptjs for password hashing.
- **UserService**: getUserProfile, updateUserProfile.
- **LessonService**: getTodayLesson, getNextLesson, completeLessonService (marks progress), submitQuiz (stores score, returns result).
- **SubscriptionService**: getPlanById, getUserSubscription, createSubscription (Stripe stub).
- **NotificationPreferenceService**: getPreferences (fetch or create defaults), updatePreferences.

**Database Seeding**:
- `prisma/seed.ts` creates initial skills (e.g., "Product Strategy", "AI Engineering") with SkillPaths (beginner → lessons).
- Sample lessons added with quizzes.
- Seed runs on `pnpm db:seed`.

---

### 3. Frontend (Next.js 14 + React 18 + TailwindCSS)

**Architecture**: Pages (App Router) → Components → Hooks → API Client

**Key Pages**:
- **Root** (`/`): Landing page with auth checks (redirects to dashboard if logged in, login if not).
- **Auth Routes** (`(auth)` route group — URLs `/login`, `/signup`, `/onboarding`):
  - `login/page.tsx` — Email/password login with API submission.
  - `signup/page.tsx` — Email/password signup with validation (8+ chars, match passwords).
  - `onboarding/page.tsx` — Post-signup: fetches skills from `/api/skills`, user selects skills + timezone + time preference.
- **Dashboard Routes** (`(dashboard)` route group — protected by ProtectedRoute HOC):
  - `page.tsx` — Dashboard home: streak, today's lesson card, start lesson button.
  - `lessons/[id]/page.tsx` — Lesson detail: fetch + display lesson content, complete button.
  - `lessons/[id]/quiz.tsx` — Quiz screen: fetch quiz, display MCQ, submit answer, show score + explanation.
  - `progress.tsx` — Stats card (current streak, total lessons, avg score) + calendar view of completion dates.
  - `settings.tsx` — User profile, notification preferences toggles (daily reminder + time, streak notifications, lesson available alerts), logout.

**Auth State Management**:
- **auth-context.tsx**: Stores JWT in localStorage. On app mount, auto-login if token exists. `useAuth()` hook provides token + setToken + logout.
- AuthProvider wraps app in layout.tsx.
- ProtectedRoute HOC checks auth, redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`.

**API Client**:
- **api-client.ts**: Fetch wrapper that auto-injects Bearer token from auth context.
- Methods: `register()`, `login()`, `getMe()`, `getSkills()`, `getTodayLesson()`, `completeLesson()`, `submitQuiz()`, `getProgress()`, `getNotificationPreferences()`, `updateNotificationPreferences()`.
- Error handling: catches 4xx/5xx responses, throws typed errors for UI to display.

**UI Components** (TailwindCSS + Lucide icons):
- Reusable form inputs (text, email, password, select, checkbox, textarea).
- Cards, buttons, badges for lessons + progress.
- Responsive design: mobile (375px) → tablet (768px) → desktop (1440px). Grids use `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3`, stacked layouts on mobile.

**Type Safety**:
- All types imported from `@learning/shared` (package alias in tsconfig).
- Shared types: User, Lesson, Quiz, UserProgress, Subscription, SubscriptionPlan, NotificationPreference, API response envelopes.

## Architectural Patterns & Decisions

### 1. System of Record Principle
**Decision**: All critical state (user auth, lesson completion, quiz scores, subscription status) stored in PostgreSQL. Frontend reads from API only — no client-side caching of state.

**Why**: Prevents desync between clients. Single source of truth for billing, progress, streaks.

### 2. Thin Client (Presentation Layer)
**Decision**: Frontend contains only UI logic + form validation. All business logic (streak calculation, lesson delivery rules, quiz scoring) in backend services.

**Why**: Prevents cheating (client-side score manipulation), ensures consistency across web/mobile, easier to change rules server-side.

### 3. Route → Controller → Service Separation
**Decision**: Express routes define endpoints, controllers validate + call services, services own business logic.

**Why**: Testable (mock services in controller tests), decoupled from HTTP layer, reusable services across routes.

### 4. JWT Authentication (Stateless)
**Decision**: No session store. JWT token issued at login, client stores in localStorage, sends with every API request.

**Why**: Scales horizontally (no session affinity), simple to implement, works well for SPA + mobile.

**Limitation**: No built-in logout (token valid until expiry). **TODO for Phase 6**: Add token expiry claims + refresh token flow to enable revocation.

### 5. Cascading Deletes
**Decision**: Deleting a User cascades to Profile, UserProgress, Subscriptions, Notifications, NotificationPreference.

**Why**: Data integrity. Deleting a user cleans up all dependent data atomically.

### 6. Skill → SkillPath → Lesson Hierarchy
**Decision**: Skills are domains (e.g., "Product Management"). SkillPaths are progression levels within a skill (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced). Lessons are daily activities within a path.

**Why**: Supports adaptive difficulty. Users select a skill, get assigned a path based on assessment, then progress through lessons.

### 7. Subscription Model (Stripe stubs retained)
**Decision**: Phase 5 (Stripe billing) was cancelled — not required for this product. `Subscription`, `SubscriptionPlan`, `StripeEventLog` models and nullable stripe ID fields remain in schema but are never populated by real payments.

**Why retained**: Subscription tier model (`free/starter/pro/premium`) is still used for AI coaching tier enforcement (`detectPlan` middleware). Stripe fields are harmless stubs.

### 9. Personalization Layer (ADR-002 — accepted, Phase 7)
**Algorithm services** (`packages/api/src/ai/`): `RecommendationEngine` (UCB1 bandit, lesson selection), `SkillTracker` (Elo rating, difficulty routing), `LearningStyleClassifier` (rule-based, style detection). These are computation units — they may read from Prisma but route all writes through the service layer.

**New DB models**: `UserSkillRating` (userId+skillId unique, Elo rating, cascade on user delete); `GeneratedLesson` (Phase 6 6.6 — adds nullable `coachingMessage` field in Phase 7). `UserProgress` gains `completionTime`, `revisitCount`, `rating` fields — `quizScore` already exists.

**Coaching flow**: `CoachingService.generateFeedback()` is called post-quiz for Pro/Premium; returns `null` immediately for free/starter; wraps AI call in try/catch so quiz delivery is never blocked. Cached in `GeneratedLesson.coachingMessage`.

**Quiz response**: `POST /api/lessons/:id/quiz` response gains a `coaching` field (`string | null`). Never omitted — null for free/starter or AI failure. Shape change is backwards-compatible.

### 8. Python AI Microservice (ADR-001 — accepted)
**Decision**: All LLM interactions (lesson generation, quiz generation, AI coaching) handled by a dedicated FastAPI Python service in repo `/Users/guypowell/Documents/Projects/learning-ai`. Node backend calls it over HTTP and validates every response with Zod. Node is system of record; Python is best-effort.

**Stack**: FastAPI + uvicorn (dev), uvicorn + gunicorn (prod, Render). Local models via Ollama (`llama3:8b` default, `mistral:7b` available). Production via Google Vertex AI. Provider switched via `AI_PROVIDER` env var.

**Trust model**: Python = best effort. Node + Zod = source of truth. All responses validated with `schema.safeParse()` before storage or serving. Failures trigger fallback chain: DB cache → static content → 503.

**Reliability**: 30s timeout (AbortController), 3 retries with exponential backoff (~150/300/600ms), circuit breaker via `opossum` (opens after 5 failures in 10s, half-open after 30s).

**Auth**: `X-Internal-API-Key` header shared between services via env var.

**Response mode**: Batch only (not streaming) — required for Zod validation invariant.

**Zod contract**: `packages/shared/src/types/ai.ts` — exported from `@learning/shared`. Single source of truth for Node↔Python data contract.

**Context flow**: Node assembles context (tier, skill_level, user_context, learning_style) → passes to Python. Python selects model and prompt variant. Node never has prompt templates or model clients.

## Offline Lesson Generation Pipeline

**Location**: `learning/scripts/` (the `learning` repo — **not** `learning-ai`). Key files: `generate-lessons.py` (~848 lines, the CLI), `lesson_config.py` (curriculum definition — tracks, levels, topics, lessons), `generate-lessons-local.py` (local-model variant).

**Nature**: This is **offline operator tooling**, not part of the runtime request path. It generates the lesson corpus ahead of time via paid AI calls (Claude API, batch and sync modes). The runtime app never invokes it. It is decoupled from the `learning-ai` FastAPI service (which handles *runtime* AI: today's-lesson personalization, coaching). Generation is a build-time concern; `learning-ai` is a serve-time concern.

**The handoff artefact**: `prisma/generated-lessons.json` (~5.6 MB, ~56k lines). This is the single, clean output of generation and the **only** input the seed reads. The seed (`prisma/seed.ts`) knows nothing about how it was produced. This file is **sacred** — irreplaceable (hundreds of person-hours + millions of tokens). Protection rules are enforced in code: only `--export` writes it (with backup + atomic rename), only `--migrate` reads it (read-only).

**Architectural principle (ticket 005, approved 2026-06-13)**: *Declare the full curriculum upfront, then fill the slots.* The pipeline builds a complete skeleton (`prisma/lesson-skeleton.json`) from `lesson_config.py` before any API call. Every lesson slot exists from the start with its `lessonNumber` assigned **once** (sorted `(topicId asc, lessonIndex asc)` per path) and **never recomputed**. A generation failure holds its slot as `status: "failed"` rather than disappearing and letting numbers close over the gap — the root-cause failure mode from ticket 004 (silent dropped lesson, renumbering).

**Skeleton ↔ export ↔ seed separation**:
- `lesson-skeleton.json` — working file, committed to git. Holds every slot + per-slot `status` (`pending`/`complete`/`failed`) + `error`. All generation activity mutates this incrementally (it is the checkpoint; the old `generate-checkpoint.json` / `batch-checkpoint.json` are retired).
- `generated-lessons.json` — written only by explicit `--export`, only when *all* slots are `complete`. Contains no status/skeleton metadata. Format unchanged — seed needs no changes.
- `seed.ts` — reads `generated-lessons.json` only. Generation and seeding are fully independent processes; one run ≠ one seed.

**Slot identity**: `track|level|topicName|lessonIndex` is the stable key joining batch results (`custom_id_map`) and `--one` targeting to skeleton slots. **Known constraint**: renaming a track/topic in `lesson_config.py` while a batch is in flight orphans results.

**Commands**: `--init` (build skeleton), `--migrate` (one-off: convert existing `generated-lessons.json` → skeleton, preserving `lessonNumber` exactly), `--generate` (default; fills pending/failed slots), `--export` (gate before seed; all-or-nothing), `--one` (repair a single slot), `--status` / `--validate` (observability).

**`isPremium`**: carried as a slot field but irrelevant during generation/sequencing — set later via the admin interface. Do not flag config/skeleton `isPremium` mismatches.

## Module Interactions

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits email + password to `/api/auth/register` or `/api/auth/login`.
2. AuthService hashes password (bcryptjs), validates, generates JWT.
3. Frontend stores JWT in localStorage, adds to Authorization header.
4. Protected routes checked by authMiddleware → validates JWT → sets req.user.

### Lesson Delivery Flow
1. Frontend calls `GET /api/lessons/today` (with auth).
2. LessonService fetches next uncompleted lesson for user based on selected skill path.
3. Frontend displays lesson content + "Complete" button.
4. User clicks → frontend calls `POST /api/lessons/:id/complete`.
5. LessonService marks UserProgress.completedAt, updates streak.
6. Frontend displays quiz screen.
7. User submits quiz → frontend calls `POST /api/lessons/:id/quiz`.
8. LessonService validates answer, stores quiz score, returns feedback.
9. Progress page fetches stats from `GET /api/users/progress`, displays streak + calendar.

### Notification Preferences Flow
1. Settings page loads → calls `GET /api/notifications/preferences`.
2. NotificationPreferenceService fetches or creates defaults.
3. User toggles options → calls `PATCH /api/notifications/preferences`.
4. Backend updates database. Frontend shows success message.
5. (Phase 5): Cron job reads NotificationPreference to send emails/push notifications.

## Data Flow & State Management

### Frontend State
- **Auth State** (auth-context): JWT token, user ID, email. Persists to localStorage.
- **Page State** (local useState): Form inputs, loading states, API responses.
- **No Redux/Zustand**: Simple useAuth hook + API client. Sufficient for MVP.

### Backend State
- **In-Memory**: Express app, middleware stack, Prisma client instance.
- **Persistent**: All user data in PostgreSQL.
- **Cache (future)**: Redis for job queues, notification scheduling (Phase 5).

---

## Integration Points

### Stripe (Stubbed, Phase 2+ scope)
- SubscriptionService.createSubscription() should call Stripe API.
- Webhook endpoint at `POST /api/subscriptions/webhook` to handle Stripe events.
- Currently mocked; no real payment processing.

### OpenAI / Mistral (Future, Phase 2+)
- Lesson content generated by LLM (not hardcoded).
- LessonService.generateLesson() will call OpenAI/Mistral API (not yet implemented).

### Email Notifications (Future, Phase 5)
- Cron job reads NotificationPreference.
- Calls email service (SendGrid or similar).
- Tracks sent notifications in Notification model.

## Architectural Gaps & Technical Debt

| Issue | Impact | Severity | Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| **No token expiry/refresh** | Leaked tokens valid forever | MEDIUM | 11 | ✅ FIXED — 15m access / 30d refresh via Redis |
| **No rate limiting** | API vulnerable to abuse | MEDIUM | 11 | ✅ FIXED — authLimiter / aiLimiter / generalLimiter |
| **CORS open (*)** | Any origin can call API | MEDIUM | 11 | ✅ FIXED — ALLOWED_ORIGINS allowlist |
| **No input sanitisation** | XSS risk on lesson content | MEDIUM | 11 | ✅ FIXED — sanitize-html on admin lesson save |
| **Stripe integration stubbed** | Can't charge users | N/A | — | 🚫 CANCELLED — not required |
| **No analytics** | Can't track user behaviour | LOW | 11.2 | ⚪ DEFERRED — provider not chosen |
| **No email notifications** | Can't remind users | MEDIUM | 12 | Push notifications live (Phase 8); email deferred |
| **No CI/CD** | No quality gate on push | MEDIUM | 12 | Phase 12 scope |

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries
- UserProgress queries on userId (indexed). Fast for "lessons completed by user".
- Subscription queries on userId (unique). Single read per user.
- Indexes prevent N+1 queries on Lesson → Quiz relationships.

### API Response Size
- Lessons include full content (markdown). May benefit from pagination (future optimization).
- Quiz responses small (question + options).

### Frontend Bundle Size
- Next.js 14 with dynamic imports on route groups. Auto-code-splitting.
- TailwindCSS (purged on build). Lucide icons (tree-shakeable).

---

## Security Posture

### Input Validation
- Controllers validate email format, password length (8+ chars), required fields.
- Frontend validates form inputs before submission.
- Backend validates all request bodies (no blind trust).

### Authentication
- Passwords hashed with bcryptjs (salted).
- JWT signed (HMAC-SHA256). Secret stored in .env.

### Sensitive Data
- JWT tokens in Authorization header (not cookies — prevents CSRF but requires manual handling in mobile).
- Refresh tokens stored hashed in Redis, never in DB or client logs.
- Database connection string in .env.

### Hardened in Phase 11
- ✅ CORS locked to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` allowlist (was `*`).
- ✅ Rate limiting on auth (5/15min), AI (10/min), general (100/min).
- ✅ Admin lesson content sanitised with `sanitize-html` before storage.
- ✅ Sentry error tracking wired (API + web + mobile); no-ops without DSN.
- ✅ Request logger + Prisma slow query logging + AI latency logging.

### Remaining gaps
- No HTTPS enforcement (dev only — handled at infra layer in prod).
- No CI/CD quality gate (Phase 12 scope).

## Change Log

**2026-06-13** — Arch review: 005-robustify-lesson-generation (required - approved)
- Approved skeleton-first generation architecture; no ADR (refinement of existing pipeline, no new integration)
- Added standing "Offline Lesson Generation Pipeline" section to context — was previously undocumented architectural area
- Key structural knowledge captured: pipeline lives in `learning/scripts/` (not `learning-ai`); it is build-time tooling decoupled from the runtime `learning-ai` FastAPI service; `generated-lessons.json` is the sacred handoff artefact; skeleton-first principle (declare curriculum upfront, `lessonNumber` assigned once, failures hold their slot)
- Constraints set for dev agent in req doc: `--migrate` orphan handling, config-rename-during-batch warning, `schema_version` check, `os.rename()` atomicity

**2026-06-12** — Arch review: 003-fix-lesson-ids (not-required)
- Mechanical rename `Lesson.day` → `Lesson.lessonNumber` — no structural change, no ADR needed
- Noted: API response shape change is breaking for un-updated consumers (mobile scoped as follow-up)

**2026-06-08** — Phase 11: Security, Analytics & Observability (11.1, 11.3, 11.4 complete; 11.2 deferred)
- JWT auth upgraded: 15m access tokens + 30d refresh tokens stored hashed in Redis
- New routes: `POST /api/auth/refresh`, `POST /api/auth/logout`
- Rate limiting middleware added (auth/AI/general tiers)
- CORS hardened to allowlist (`ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var)
- Lesson content sanitised with `sanitize-html` on admin save
- Sentry wired across API, web, mobile (graceful no-op without DSN)
- Request logger, Prisma slow query logging, AI latency logging added
- Phase 5 (Stripe) cancelled; Phase 10.2 (Team Stripe) cancelled
- API test count: 206 (was 184)

**2026-04-17** — ADR-003: Push Notification Architecture (Phase 8)
- Mobile: Expo Push Service (`expo-server-sdk`) — no Firebase account required
- Web: Web Push API (`web-push` npm) + VAPID keys — no external account required
- New `PushToken` model: `(userId, platform, deviceId)` unique, cascade on user delete — supports multi-device
- Unified `PushNotificationService` abstraction routes by platform — never throws (notification failure is non-blocking)
- `node-cron` for MVP (daily + evening jobs in `packages/api/src/jobs/`) — Bull deferred to Phase 11
- New `StreakService`: pure-function milestone/message helpers + `isStreakAtRisk()` (reads UserProgress + timezone)
- Cron idempotency: 20-hour guard via `Notification` table before any send
- VAPID keys: `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`, `VAPID_SUBJECT` in env — never committed
- `POST /api/notifications/push-token` added to notifications router (protected)
- Full ADR: `docs/adr/ADR-003-push-notification-architecture.md`

**2026-04-17** — ADR-002: Node Personalization Architecture (Phase 7)
- `quizScore` already exists on `UserProgress` — only add `completionTime`, `revisitCount`, `rating`
- Algorithm services (`RecommendationEngine`, `SkillTracker`, `LearningStyleClassifier`) in `packages/api/src/ai/` (computation units, not data-access services)
- Coaching tier enforcement in `CoachingService.generateFeedback()` not route middleware — quiz route open to all tiers
- Coaching cache in `GeneratedLesson.coachingMessage` (nullable String) — not Redis
- `LearningStyleClassifier` returns style string; caller invokes `UserService.updateUserProfile()` — no direct DB writes
- `Skill` model needs `userSkillRatings UserSkillRating[]` backrelation for migration
- Phase 6 Chunk 6.6 prerequisite: `GeneratedLesson` model must exist before Phase 7 coaching cache

**2026-04-14** — ADR-001: Python AI Microservice
- Accepted architecture for all AI interactions: FastAPI Python service in `learning-ai` repo
- Ollama (llama3:8b + mistral:7b) local; Vertex AI prod; switched via AI_PROVIDER env var
- Node trust model: Zod validates all Python responses; fallback chain on failure
- Reliability: 30s timeout, 3 retries exp backoff, opossum circuit breaker
- Phase 6 (AI generation) and Phase 7 (personalization) updated to reflect this architecture
- Phase 5 (Stripe billing) unchanged
- ADR written at `docs/adr/ADR-001-python-ai-service.md`

**2026-04-12** — Initialization Complete
- Read fs.md (full stack context).
- Read Prisma schema: 11 models with cascading deletes, unique constraints, indexes.
- Read API structure: 5 route modules, service layer, error handling middleware.
- Read frontend structure: Next.js 14 with route groups, auth context, API client.
- Documented system architecture, module interactions, data flows.
- Identified architectural patterns (system of record, thin client, JWT auth, cascading deletes).
- Identified gaps (token expiry, rate limiting, Stripe stubbed, AI generation stubbed, email notifications).
- All decisions documented with reasoning and Phase assignments.
